# Comparison of Less & Sass (SCSS)

This is a comparison of [Less] and [Sass] (as written in the SCSS syntax), designed to showcase the
similarities and differences of the languages, so that it's easier to choose between them based on
actual language features, rather than on some team lead's preference, or on some perception that
everyone's using one or the other.

## The Files

If you're here to compare, the main files you'll wanna look at are _main.less_ and _main.scss_, as
well as _main.less.css_ (output style: "Regular") and _main.scss.css_ (output style: "Expanded"),
'cause I feel like those are the most comparable and easy-to-read.

The _output-styles/_ directory contains the same styles, output in each available output style in
each language.  If output style is a deciding factor for you and your team, that's where you can
compare the available options.

## Contributing

Open a pull request and I'll review it.  I reserve the right to change any phrasing I feel is too
opinionated.  Likewise, I welcome discussions of phrasing I have chosen, as my aim is impartiality
and helpful information.

This project is built with [CodeKit], 'cause CodeKit is dope.  I don't mind any other task managers,
but none is as easy as CodeKit.

If you do choose to contribute—whether by opening a pull request or an issue—keep the following in
mind:

### Purpose

This repo is not meant to draw any conclusions on its own, but to showcase the strengths and
weaknesses of each language's feature set, relative to the other's.  Having said that, I'm not gonna
pretend that I'm not biased.  Everyone's biased.  But be civil.

### Scope

For simplicity, the scope of this project is just the latest releases of each primary compiler.
In practice, that's limited to what is available in the latest version of CodeKit, but that's fine
with me.
